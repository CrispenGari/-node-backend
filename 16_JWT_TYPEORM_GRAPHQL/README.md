### JsonWebToken (jwt) full stack authentication

This is a walk through on how to do full stack authentication using jwt from backend to frontend.

We are going to learn how to intergrate the backend server with the frontend server to do basic authentication using:

### backend
1. TypeScript
2. Express
3. Apollo Server Express
4. PostGres
5. TypeGraphQL
6. bcryptjs
7. jwt

### Frontend
1. React.js
2. Typescript
3. GraphQL code generator
4. Apollo
5. Axios
6. React Context API

This application will not be styled since the goal is to learn how we can authenticate the user using jwt tokens.
