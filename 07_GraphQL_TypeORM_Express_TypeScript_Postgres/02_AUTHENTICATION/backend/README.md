### Authentication

We are going to implement authentication using `graphql`, `type-ORM`, `postgres` and `express`. We will work from start to finish on the implementation of the backend authentication. This is similar or almost the same as what we did in the `makro-ORM` authentication, all we have to do is to change some few files. All the files that are going to change, their code will be in this README.md file. Note that we need to install `tyoeorm` as follows:

```shell
yarn add typeorm
```
