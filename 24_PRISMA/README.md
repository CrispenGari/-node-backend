### What is prisma?

Prisma provides a set of tools that enable you to access and interact with your database. While offering many of the same features a traditional `ORM` would, `Prisma` describes itself as a _next-gen ORM_ because of its unique implementation of what is known as the `"data-mapper"` model of ORM and its careful consideration of `Type-Safe` interactions.

Along with offering a great `ORM` tool (the Prisma Client), `Prisma` also offers a database migration tool called Prisma Migrate and a nice GUI that allows you to visualize and update data in your connected database called Prisma Studio.

### What databases does prisma support?

Currently prisma supports the following database engines:

1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. MongoDB
4. SQLitle
5. MSSQL
