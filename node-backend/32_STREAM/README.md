### Stream

In this sub repository we are going to implement real time chat application using stream. First we are going to implement the server for a basic authentication then later on we are going to implement the client which is a react-native app with expo.

First we need to go to https://getstream.io/ and create an account so that we can start working with stream. After that go ahead and create a new app in the dashboard so that we can get some keys.
