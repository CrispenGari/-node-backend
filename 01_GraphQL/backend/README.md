### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. **GraphQL works with any database**.

### GraphQL Backend

In this series we are going to look at how we can create a `GraphQL` express server and be able to interact with it on the frontend.

### Installation

```shell
npm install express
```

- For creating an express app.

```shell
npm install express-graphql
```

- Helps express to work with graphQL

```shell
npm install graphql
```

- The main language.
